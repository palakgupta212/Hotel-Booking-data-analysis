# Hotel-Booking-data-analysis

Overview:-

This project analyzes a dataset of hotel bookings to understand the key factors that lead to booking cancellations. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and actionable insights to help hotels reduce cancellation rates and optimize operations.

Project Objective:-

-> Analyze hotel booking data to identify cancellation patterns.

-> Use Excel to perform data cleaning, filtering, pivoting, and visualization.

-> Derive actionable insights to assist decision-making for hotel operations.

Sample Insights:-

-> City hotels have a significantly higher cancellation rate than resort hotels.

-> Long lead times often result in a higher probability of cancellation.

-> No deposit bookings are more likely to be canceled.

-> Repeat guests cancel less frequently than first-time visitors.

Tools Used:-

-> Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, Charts, Formulas)

-> CSV dataset from Kaggle

Conclusion:-

Excel provides a strong foundation for analyzing hotel booking behavior. Even without advanced tools, we can extract meaningful insights that help improve hotel business strategies.

Future Enhancements:-

-> Use Excelâ€™s Power Query and Power Pivot for deeper analysis

-> Integrate with Power BI for dynamic dashboards

-> Compare year-over-year data for trend analysis
